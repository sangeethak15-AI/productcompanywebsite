            The mobile phone can be used to communicate over long distances without wires.
            It works by communicating with a nearby base station (also called a "mobile tower") which 
            connects it to the main phone network. When moving, if the mobile phone gets too far away from the cell it 
            is connected to, that cell sends a message to another cell to tell the new cell to take over the call. 
            This is called a "hand off," and the call continues with the new cell the phone is connected to. 
            The hand-off is done so well and carefully that the user will usually never even know that the call was transferred to another cell.
            <ul>
            As mobile phones became more popular, they began to cost less money,
            and more people could afford them. Monthly plans became available for rates as low as US$30
            or US$40 a month. Cell phones have become so cheap to own that they have mostly replaced pay phones
            and phone booths except for urban areas with many people.
